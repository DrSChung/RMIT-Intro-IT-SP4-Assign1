		<article>
		<p>I am Dr Stephen Chung. I followed my parents and migrated to Australia from Hong Kong in late 1980, hence I also speak fluent Cantonese. I am a practicing medical specialist and senior consultant physician in rehabilitation medicine for over 15 years. I completed my Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery and Bachelor of Science (Medicine) (M.B.B.S. B.Sc.(Med)) at University of New South Wales. I then obtained my Graduate Certificate in Management at A.G.S.M. (combined UNSW & USyd) prior to my medical specialty training in rehabilitation medicine. Thereafter, I graduated from my Master degree in Health Administration (M.H.A.) at UNSW, and also pursued my interests in studying in pain medicine & management as well as assistive equipment & technology for my patients with variety of impairments and disabilities. I am also a representative of Royal Australasian Collage of Physicians to a sub-committee of NSW Health, an U.S. Board certified independent medical assessor, as well as a licensed real estate agent and an auctioneer. I enjoy indoor sports like squash, table tennis and badminton, as well as outdoor sports like snow skiing. I also enjoy my quite time watching good movies and TV shows e.g. MasterChef&trade;, and of course traveling with my family and friends. My latest hobby is about to start my veggie patch.

		<h1>Interest in I. T.</h1>
		<article>
		<p>My curiosity in I.T. was reignited from my early interests in personal computing and computer language BASIC in 1980s when I got my email address with Hotmail in 1990s, and wondered not only how world wide web worked but how &lsquo;www&rsquo; would take our future into. In between years, I strived to keep up with digital technology, such as digital mobile phone, and information technology advancement by way of taking short courses in webpage development and e-commerce. Then came the waves of social media bloom and smartphones growth. As a non-IT person and an end-consumer, I tried to follow IT waves but the challenges are harder each time. When I need to, and being responsible to, set up my home network for my family, I wish I knew it all. I have limited IT experience as an average end-user consumer. Nevertheless, in my medical practice in rehabilitation medicine, I expose to pioneering technology in healthcare for patients, from emerging personal assistive technology to automation and integration into living environment. I also researched the use of interactive computer assistive technology such as VVii&trade; and XBOX&trade; for my patient&apos;s therapy with some but limited success, and concluded that it was partly due to inappropriate user interface. I tried and changed over to Makey Makey&trade; and adapted the user interface to suit my patient&apos;s limited abilities and achieved better outcomes. This is consistent with the known experience that if a patient doesn&apos;t want to use a piece of equipment, such as a caliper, it doesn&apos;t matter how appropriate it is for the patient. Therefore, I would like to explore further in user interface in I.T. industry for my patient cohort.
<br>I believe building and advancing my career in I.T. requires broad spectrum of knowledge and experience in this field, just as my general medical and surgical training prior to my medical specialist training. Therefore, I wish to gain a solid foundation in I.T. knowledge through this course study. The next stage will be to gain broad experience in I.T. industry. I believe starting with sounded understanding and experience in end-users&apos; view will enrich my insight into I.T. career development. Therefore, I envisage to become an U.I./U.X. designer to gain such experience while further my studies in Master/PhD in I.T. in my interested field of machine learning engineering or quantum computing. My goal is to improve quality of life of my patients who suffer from various impairments and disabilities, not just with my medical knowledge but also by way of utilizing my lI.T. knowledge, skills and experience to develop user-appropriate and affordable technology and equipment for their benefits.

<br>
<br><b>Why RMIT?</b>

<br>I believe RMIT University is a highly reputable 5-star university in tertiary studies in Information Technology studies and researches and with strong, versatile and keen academic staff to foster and support their students to their achievements. RMIT University&apos;s online course with great flexibility and support suits my needs very well when I prefer to keep my medical practice while pursuing my I.T. knowledge and experience. I am grateful this option is available to me.

</h5>
		<p><b>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b>
<br>These test results provide me some objective, statistically validated analysis of what I think I know of myself. I reflected these test results on my life experience and learnt about myself better, especially in my shortfalls and how to encompass variety of personalities and styles.
<br>
<br><b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b>
<br>I believe these test results evoke my awareness of my shortfalls that could impact on my behaviour and effective interaction with other team members. I also draw my experience as the default team leader in my 3 different multi-disciplinary teams for weekly case conference at 3 different hospitals. I learnt that if there is a well-defined and well-accepted culture and expectations within the team, most team members will behave within the invisible boundaries. Nevertheless, building and refining such team culture can be a challenge and knowing test results like these would helpful in doing so.
<br>
<br><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b>
<br>When forming and working with a team, I pursue the ideology of able to work with various personality and character. Naturally, it may be an advantage to know the strength and weakness of each team member, but mindful the intrinsic bias comes when relying on these test results. Therefore, I prepare and welcome all prospective team members and would prefer connect and communicate with them all so to develop good rapport at early stage. I believe a good team leader should be able to manage most, if not all, sorts of team members by various management skills and tactics. As a team member, I will do the best of my part.

		<h1>Project Idea</h1>
		<p><b>Overview</b>
		<br>The world embraces modern computing and information technology, though miniaturization, sleek interface and sophisticated functionality hinder the already disadvantaged minority with physical and other disabilities from benefiting but fall into oblivion. What supposedly revolutionizing life experience for better in our society is not always materialized in this minority group. More than 2.5M Australian suffer from physical restrictions amongst other disabilities and over 1M of them did not use internet in last 3 months of survey period by Australian Bureau of Statistics [1]. This project is the first phase of my schema to develop, with a pragmatic methodology, highly customizable controller devices as user interface for people with disabilities, and further develop a holistic welcoming service to a better quality and experience in life.
My vision: If you can just do a little bit, a lot we will do for you. And the more you can do, the more we can do for you.

		</p>

		<p><b>Motivation</b>

		<br>If you have some disabilities and are not able to pour yourself a glass of water, you may feel modern technology difficult to use, if not intimidating. Imagine a technology you have no control of! Feel like losing control of your car in snow? Many Australians suffer from some disabilities and preclude from harnessing modern technology both in therapy and lifestyle choices like others. Modern technology endeavors to embrace everyone. 
		<br>
		<br><b>Need:</b> People with disabilities have difficulties in controlling and using modern technology. Langan et al [2] concluded that the use of technology is not popular in stroke patients despite its use improved patients&apos; performance and engagement. They are missing out. 
		<br>
		<br><b>Market Prospect:</b> According to July 2020 updated data revealing the use of technology by people with disability from ABS 2018 Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers data [1], there are 3,822,600 (~17.7%) of Australian population have disabilities. Of those, 2,529,200 (66.16%) suffer from physical restriction amongst other disabilities, the highest disability incident of the Disability Groups. From the data, 1,088,700 (28.48%) of people with disability did not use internet in last 3 months of survey period. While 15-44 years and 45-64 years age groups are only 0.12% and 5.14% respectively of the 28.48%, 65 years and above is the majority (848,100 or 22.19%).
		<br>
		<br><b>Reason:</b> Help them re-integrate to the world. Modern I.T. changes business models and model of living and our lifestyle adapts supposedly for better, e.g. online banking, online shopping, and some home automation. However, some people with disabilities cannot accomplish cumbersome multi-step process, such as 2-factor authentication, ticking 3 or 4 more ultra-small boxes for consent to T&Cs, the company&apos;s privacy policies, marketing campaign, confirm correct information. This needs to be modulated.
		</p>
		

		<p><b>Description</b>
		<br>To people with disabilities, modern I.T. is like a double-edged sword. While digitalization, fast processing speed and synchronization, improve motion detection accuracy, and miniaturization transform many equipment from portable to wearable, users with disabilities encounter challenging experience when interacting with these gadgets. The primary goal of this project is to improve user experience and achieve and maintain high participation rate in I.T. use in this cohort. I will design a protocol in evaluating these customers both from medical, functional and I.T. user prospective, collect and analyze the data from the protocol and further develop a pragmatic methodology for future customers.
		<br>The scheme of the protocol as below:
		<br>1.	Customer assessment & analysis &#8208; analyze customer can & can&apos;t do &#8208; physical, sensory (including vision and hearing), cognition including problem-solving skills e.g. when encounter a mistake. 
		<br>2.	Goal settings with customers/families &#8208; determine and agree what can/likely be able to achieve with technology use. Outcomes will be in short term: able to use and do things as expected, quality of life improvement; and in long-term: improve ability, maintain I.T. participation, and modify accordingly to improve further.
		<br>3.	Hardware prescription &#8208; match, modify or design most appropriate control device to suit physical restrictions, try and modify accordingly to achieve good user satisfaction and function. Then match the functionality of selected control device to prospective technology or gadget for trial use and if attain desirable outcomes.
		<br>4.	Software prescription &#8208; elevate and modify software to suit patient&apos;s abilities, such as reducing or bypassing all unnecessary steps.
		<br>5.	Testing and accumulating data and experience for future referencing.
		<br>6.	Identify determining factors in each step for protocol analysis.
		<br>7.	Develop a secure reliable digital platform for our clients (by subscription) so to facilitate simplifying their authentications to other online/digital media.

		</p>


		<p><b>Tools & Technology</b>
		<br>I will need a pre-selection, and supply of, commercially available terminal control devices. I consider VVii&trade; with motion sensors, VVii Switch&trade; with wearable sensors and controller, XBOX&trade; with Kinect&trade;, Makey Makey&trade;, Leap Motion Controller&trade;, and variety of joysticks, keyboards, mouse, stylus, cameras and microphones.
		<br>
		<br>I will need internet access and a range pre-selection of software and programs to assess what the customer can achieve with a selection of control devices. I consider publicly accessible sources such as government websites, internet banking portals for major banks, voice recognition software in social media, as well as commonly used and readily available software programs like word processing. I will also include using media for entertainment and lifestyle matters.
		<br>
		<br>I will need to set up a database to analysis the protocol for improvement.

		</p>


		<p><b>Skills Required</b>
		<br>I will provide the relevant medical expertise in assessing and evaluating customer&apos;s impairments and disabilities as well as team leadership. I will also be one of UX/UI designers to learn and build my experience. I anticipate my team will include:
		<br>&bull; an occupational therapist to help assessing ADLs and some functional outcome measures;
		<br>&bull; a clinical psychologist to evaluate short-term & long-term user experience and quality of life change;
		<br>&bull; an experienced speech therapist to help determining language ability and deficits in details;
		<br>&bull; an UI & UX designer with wireframing experience and compassion to understand the customer&apos;s special needs and to develop customer&apos;s user performa;
		<br>&bull; legal advice to consult for relevant legal implications with my products and services.


		</p>

	
		<p><b>Outcomes</b>
		<br>The mission is developing an expert team who knows users with disabilities their issues, limitations and wishes and &ldquo;prescribe&rdquo; them appropriate technology suite and set-up for their uses, just like a doctor knows a patient&apos;s health problem and prescribe the correct medications with one simple outcome: Better.
		<br>
		<br>For this project, I evaluate 3 aspects of outcomes:
		<br>1.	happy customers
		<br>2.	customers maintain use of I.T.
		<br>3.	build experience and database from customers and develop an efficient, accurate and reliable technology prescribing methodology for future clients
